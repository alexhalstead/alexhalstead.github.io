title: About Me

<h1>Historian, Microbiologist, DIYer</h1>
<p>Hey! You found me! My name is Alex Halstead and I just graduated from Oregon State University with a degree in Food Science. My speciality is in Fermentation and my passions are History and Microbiology.</p>
<p>I grew up in Newberg, Oregon which is nestled in the Chehalem Valley next to the Willamette River. Chehalem is the Kalapuyan name meaning "Valley of Flowers" and I'm lucky to have grown up in such a beautiful area.</p>
<p>My dream is to start a Funkhouse and begin Yeast Ranching to make an assortment of fermented foods.</p>

<p>You can find me on social media</p>
