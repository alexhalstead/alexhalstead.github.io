<h1>Historian, Microbiologist, DIYer</h1>
<p>Hey! You found me! My name is Alex Halstead and I just graduated from Oregon State University with a degree in Food Science. My speciality is in Fermentation and my passions are History and Microbiology.</p>
<p>I grew up in Newberg, Oregon between Chehalem Valley and the Willamette River. Chehalem is an old Kalapuyan word meaning "Valley of Flowers" and I'm lucky to have grown up in such a beautiful area.</p>
